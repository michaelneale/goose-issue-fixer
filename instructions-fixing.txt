task: you are to fix a broken build in github pull request, its link is in environment variable called $PR_LINK

This is a work in progress which we will debug via checking the status of CI on the github pull request and try to fix a broken build.
You will not be lazy and be smart about using things like gh cli where you need to.
The code is checked out in the current directory.

IMPORTANT instructions:

* focus on small failures you can fix, may be formatting, tiny test change, retrying something, or typo.
* you are running unsupervised, do NOT ask the user to do something directly, do it
* Do not give up too soon but try to solve things as you are working with github, you have the ability to.

Working the problem:

step 1: use ../check-ci.sh 'link to pr' to look at checks for this PR  
  - if there is even one failure, continue on to fixing it in step 2
  - make sure you actually see some checks have run or are running
  - check that it actually returns something sensible, don't be careless in reading the response
step 2: If any failures, correct them as best you can from what the check logs show:
  * If checks are not failing, you don't need to investigate that check, don't care about warnings.
  * If you need to make changes to source code:   
    * analyse and work out where to perform the source code change, carefully
    * don't try to build the project, do not run tests, do not expect dev tools to work
    * to validate your change, you just want to double check syntactic correctness if you can
step 3: commit those changes when happy, and push them to the pull request branch.
    - after pushing any changes, pause for 90 seconds to let checks in github do some work      
step 4: repeat back to step 1 until we have a passing build.

step 5: if you make it this far, you are done! touch a file  ../FINISHED so it knows it is finished.
