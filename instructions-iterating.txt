task: the github issue in the $ISSUE_LINK environment variable.


This is a work in progress which we will debug via checking the status of CI on the github pull request.
You will not be lazy and be smart about using things like gh cli where you need to.

IMPORTANT instructions:

* use ../check-issue.sh $ISSUE_LINK to remind yourself of the issue being worked on.
* use gh cli to check that there is a PR for this branch we are working on. 
* you are running unsupervised, do NOT ask the user to do something directly, do it
* Do not give up but try to solve things if you are working with github, you have the ability to.
* if there is no PR, you may need to open one from the pushed branch.

Now iterate towards a solution:

step 1: use ../check-ci.sh 'link to pr' to look at checks for this PR  
  - if there is even one failure, continue on to fixing it in step 2
  - if no failures yet, and not finished all the checks, wait 90 seconds and back to step 1
  - make sure you actually see some checks have run to know the PR is open
  - check that it actually returns something sensible, don't be careless.
step 2: If any failures, correct them as best you can from what the check logs show:
  * If checks are not failing, you don't need to investigate that check
  * If you need to make changes to source code:   
    * analyse and work out where to perform the source code change, carefully
    * don't try to build the project, do not run tests, do not expect dev tools to work
    * to validate your change, you just want to double check syntactic correctness if you can
step 3: commit those changes when happy, and push with gh cli
    - after pushing any changes, pause for 90 seconds to let checks in github do some work      
step 4: repeat back to step 1 until we have a passing build.       

step 5: use ../check-pr.sh 'put link to PR here' to check if there are any comments which mention @goose in the PR, if there are new ones, address them and repeat.
  - this may mean thinking and making a code change or it may mean making a comment to answer the question.
  - if need to make code changes and commit
  - try to not add any redundant comments or changes if you already have addressed it (look at recent comments if not sure)
  - repeat back to step 1 to check on things.

step 6: if you make it this far, you are done! touch a file  ../FINISHED so it knows it is finished.
