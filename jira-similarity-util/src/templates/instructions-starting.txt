task: Create a Pull Request against {repo} that solves the issue described in the jira ticket with key {original_ticket_key}.

IMPORTANT instructions:

* you are running unsupervised, do NOT ask the user to do something directly, do it
* Check for context files within the {issue_cache_directory} to help guide your approach
  - `llm_context_issue_summary.md` contains a summary of the ticket along with summaries of other tickets, ranked by similarity.
  - `raw_issues.json` contains the raw JSON representation of all jira tickets that were fetched
* If you think a similar issue is relevant, and it has a linked pull request URL, you can view details about that pull request using the gh cli
  - use gh pr view <url> to see general details and the PR description
  - use gh pr diff <url> to see the actual code changes
* After looking at the Summary and Description of the original JIRA ticket, as well as the context for similar tickets, you can run the {development_dir}/goose-issue-fixer/jira-similarity-util/target/release/jira-similarity-util search -keywords=<keywords> -components=<components> -labels=<labels> -project=<project> to search for additional JIRA tickets that might be relevant
* You can find the git repository to work from checked out in the {development_dir} directory
  - that directory contains multiple repos that are checked out, you are interested in {repo} 
* make a branch in git before making any changes named suitably
  - Ideally, it should be named {suggested_branch_name}
* analyse and work out where to perform the source code change, carefully
* don't try to build the project, do not run tests, do not expect dev tools to work
* to validate your change, you just want to double check syntactic correctness if you can
* once reasonably happy with change (even if not perfect):
  - push it as a branch to the origin repo
  - use gh cli to open it as a pull request in draft state
    - The title of the PR should start with [{original_ticket_key}][Goose]
    - At the end of the PR description, include the JIRA ticket key ({original_ticket_key}) and a mention that this code was all generated via Goose based on the ticket
  - check the PR has been opened, be smart, not lazy
    - use the gh cli to view the PR and confirm it exists
    - check to make sure the latest commit has been pushed to the remote
  - once you know PR has started, you are finished, exit.
