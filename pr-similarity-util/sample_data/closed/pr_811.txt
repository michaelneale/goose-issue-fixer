+![Introducing codename goose](introducing-codename-goose.png)
+
+We are thrilled to announce **codename goose**, your on-machine, open source AI agent built to automate your tasks. 
+
+Powered by your choice of [large language models (LLMs)](/docs/getting-started/providers), a user-friendly desktop interface and CLI, and [extensions](/docs/getting-started/using-extensions) that integrate with your existing tools and applications, Goose is designed to enhance your productivity and workflow.
+
+<!--truncate-->
+
+
+You can think of Goose as an assistant that is ready to take your instructions, and do the work for you.
+
+While Goose's first use cases are engineering focused, the community has been exploring other non-engineering use cases for Goose as well. And it goes without saying, Goose is [open source](https://github.com/block/goose) ðŸŽ‰.
+
+
+## How Goose Works
+
+Goose operates as an intelligent, autonomous agent capable of handling complex tasks through a well-orchestrated coordination of its core features:
+  
+- **Using Extensions**: [Extensions](/docs/getting-started/using-extensions) are key to Gooseâ€™s adaptability, providing you the ability to connect with applications and tools that you already use. Whether itâ€™s connecting to GitHub, accessing Google Drive or integrating with JetBrains IDEs, the possibilities are extensive. Some of these extensions have been curated in the [extensions](/extensions) directory. Goose extensions are built on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) - enabling you to build or bring your own custom integrations to Goose. 
+
+- **LLM Providers**: Goose is compatible with a wide range of [LLM providers](/docs/getting-started/providers), allowing you to choose and integrate your preferred model. 
+
+- **CLI and Desktop Support**: You can run Goose as a desktop app or through the command-line interface (CLI) using the same configurations across both.
+
+## Goose in Action
+
+Goose is able to handle a wide range of tasks, from simple to complex, across various engineering domains. Here are some examples of tasks that Goose has helped people with:
+
+- Conduct code migrations such as Ember to React, Ruby to Kotlin, Prefect-1 to Prefect-2 etc. 
+- Dive into a new project in an unfamiliar coding language
+- Transition a code-base from field-based injection to constructor-based injection in a dependency injection framework.
+- Conduct performance benchmarks for a build command using a build automation tool
+- Increasing code coverage above a specific threshold
+- Scaffolding an API for data retention
+- Creating Datadog monitors
+- Removing or adding feature flags etc.
+- Generating unit tests for a feature
