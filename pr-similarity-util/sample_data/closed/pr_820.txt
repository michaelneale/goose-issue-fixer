This PR addresses documentation feedback by improving clarity, enhancing usability, and reducing duplication with reusable components. Key updates include:

1. **Reusable Components:**
   - Added `SupportedEnvironments.js`:
     - Displays information about supported platforms and architectures.
   - Added `RateLimits.js`:
     - Provides guidance on billing, free-tier options, and rate limit management.

2. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Replaced inline admonitions with reusable components (`SupportedEnvironments` and `RateLimits`) in:
     - `installation.md`
     - `managing-goose-sessions.md`
     - `quickstart.md`
   - Updated session management instructions:
     - Added guidance for starting new sessions in the Goose UI.
     - Added a tip recommending new sessions for distinct use cases to maintain organized workflows.
