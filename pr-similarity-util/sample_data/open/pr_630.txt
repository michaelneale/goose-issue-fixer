This change allows "Goose" (not user, not assistant) to show information to the user which is outside of the user's conversation with the llm, and avoids sending those out-of-band messages to the llm.

ideally, visually, it would be nice to update the prompt so Goose-messages show as a third speaker.

changelist:
* add role Goose
* after truncation, create message to user from Role::Goose and append to the message history
* filter out these Goose-messages before sending to llm-preprocessing
* after llm response, render llm response, then render any goose response if one exists

this keeps the Goose messages in the message history.
