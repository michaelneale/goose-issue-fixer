Sometimes i want to rerun a previous prompt with goose when the underlying data has changed. This change will print the previous prompts when resuming a session to help remind me of the context and help me copy paste older prompts that were effective.

Also fixed help output since `--session` flag doesn't exists. It's suppose to be the `--name` flag.

Resumed session
```
❯ ./target/debug/goose session -r --name t7alxs5d
resuming session | provider: databricks model: claude-3-5-sonnet-2
    logging to /Users/atish/.config/goose/sessions/t7alxs5d.jsonl

Previous prompts for resuming session:
> find all the csv files in the ./tmp directory. 
> Use the data in the csv files to create a new csv file that shows total number of empty nodes per dc compared to the total number of nodes
