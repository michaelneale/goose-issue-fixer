- add a prompts.rs to goose-server/routes with additional /prompts/list and /prompts/get/:prompt_name routes that call the passthrough respectively
- implement passthrough in agents
- add the list_prompts and get_prompt declarations on the mcpclienttrait
- implement list_prompts and get_prompt in mcp-client/client.rs
