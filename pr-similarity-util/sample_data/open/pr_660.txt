Saw someone in [Slack](https://sq-block.slack.com/archives/C06PBQ52MCK/p1735877634229599) wish for a way to easily copy and paste markdown code in input or have a WYSIWYG input like Slack.

While this doesnt allow you to paste and it preserves formatting. It does make it easier to:
- add markdown to text like bold, italics, quotes, bullets etc because there is a WYSIWYG buttons
- also it makes it easier to format code..you don't manually have to type backticks
- and you can preview what it looks like before you press send

Final decision for this was to convert this to a popover/floating toolbar.

Demo toggling formatting, position of floating toolbar/markdown popover, and preview
