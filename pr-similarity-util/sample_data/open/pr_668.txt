we missed [these prompt methods](https://github.com/block/goose/blob/23987f7c892e31b10445488149dcc47680f20c45/crates/goose-mcp/src/developer/mod.rs#L846-L887) (used to be in developer1) during the [cleanup](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/663). will make a PR to add them to current developer (no rush since we don't currently support them)
