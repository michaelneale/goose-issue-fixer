I mentioned this as a joke, but I think this is a useful feature. 

**Update**
Changed the concept of the cage mode to actually something security useful. 


1. Caged Mode (Most Restrictive)
   - No extensions can be enabled or added
   - No tools can be used
   - All extension-related UI actions are disabled
   - Default startup mode for maximum security

2. Cage Free Mode
   - Only built-in extensions can be enabled
   - Only built-in tools are allowed (developer__, computercontroller__, 
     memory__, jetbrains__, platform__)
   - Cannot browse extension site or add manual extensions
   - Suitable for using core functionality without external components

3. Free Range Mode
   - Can enable built-in extensions
   - Can browse and install extensions from the official site
   - Cannot manually add custom extensions
   - All tools are allowed
   - Good balance of functionality and security

4. Wild Mode (Least Restrictive)
   - Full access to all extensions and tools
   - Can manually add custom extensions
   - Can browse and install from extension site
   - No restrictions on extension sources
   - Suitable for development and testing
